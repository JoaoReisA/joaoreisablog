It always seemed a bit strange to me to make introductions, but since we're here, here's a little about who I am.

I'm 23 years old and currently work as a mobile software engineer at SofiBank, using Flutter and native technologies. I'm here to share the little knowledge I have and to learn along the journey. At the moment, I've been very interested in using Go for my projects and learning a little more about backend, who knows, maybe I'll work with it in the future. Outside of the IT world, I skateboard, play guitar, and I'm always picking up a new hobby that I'm bad at but have fun with.
